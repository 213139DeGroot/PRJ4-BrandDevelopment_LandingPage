            <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
            <h5>A colour scheme:</h5>

            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                    <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #a4386b;"></span>
                    #A4386B
                    <em>
                        We chose pink, because it can be associated with feelings of femininity, playfulness, and warmth.
                        It may also appeal to our target audience as a way to express their personal style and individuality.
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #e7e5df;"></span>
                    #E7E5DF
                    <em>
                        Light creamy colour is a versatile colour that can be paired with many other colours.
                        It can work well as a background colour for designs and can help other colours to stand out.
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #2a2b2e;"></span>

                    <em>
                        Dark grey is often associated with sophistication, elegance, and luxury.
                        It can help to create a sense of high-quality and premium-ness.
                    </em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Font Choices:</h5>
            <p>
                <b>- Abril Fatface</b> is a stylish and elegant font that adds a touch of sophistication to our brand.
                It has thick and bold serifs that make it stand out, making it perfect for headlines and titles.<br>
                <b>- Raleway</b> is a versatile sans-serif font that is widely used in various design projects.
                It has a modern and clean look, with elegant and geometric shapes that give it a professional and sophisticated appearance.
                This font is perfect for branding and advertising, as it easily communicates our brand message in a clear and concise way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>User interface patterns:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Navigation bar:</b> A horizontal navigation bar that sticks to the top of the screen,
                    making the navigation capabilities always accessible. Furthermore, when the website is accessed via a mobile phone,
                    a dropdown menu appears, neatly hiding the navigation links behind a hamburger menu icon.
                    This ensures that the navbar will not be too cluttered on mobile.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Carousel:</b> We decided to go for a carousel as the 'hero'-element of our homepage,
                    immediately welcoming the visitors with beautiful imagery of classic Dutch landscapes/views.
                    On top of that, we added a title and a button, to make the welcoming experience more personal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Links:</b> To be able to easily guide visitors towards other pages on the site itself,
                    but also external pages (Instagram, Facebook), links have been used to make these other pages more accessible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cards:</b> For certain important elements (testimonials, values, team members), we decided to make them
                    stand out more by using cards. This enabled us to add a different color, a shadow and a small hover animation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Forms:</b> We wanted to give our very interested visitors the possibility to sign up for our newsletter.
                    Furthermore, we wanted to make it easy for our visitors to contact us. Hence, we used forms to enable visitors
                    to fill in their information and/or message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Footer:</b> Most websites have a footer, and this is for a reason. It phisically closes off the website,
                    while simultanuously enabling the developer to guide the visitor's attention to important links.
                    We decided to put links to our social media pages on the footer, to generate more traffic on our social pages.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Structure of navigation and content</h5>
            <p>
                The navigation bar at the top of the page enables visitors to easily navigate through our website.
                We decided to divide the site into 3 main pages: Home, About Us and Contact:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Home:</b> This page is the landing page, giving visitors a first impression of our brand and product.
                        The imagery, colors, font and copywriting welcome the user to our brand. Here you will find information about
                        the product and general information about our brand.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>About Us:</b> This page contains more in-depth information about our brand, such as: <em>Vision, Mission, Values, Persona</em> and <em>Our team.</em></li>
                    <li><b>Contact:</b> This page is pretty self-explanatory: it gives visitors the opportunity to contact us.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 id="production-1.1" class="mt-2">Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to serve as a <b>pre-launch website</b> for our product. We chose to take this approach, because:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We want to generate interest and buzz for our upcoming product launch: By creating a pre-launch website, we can start building excitement and anticipation for our product.
                        This will help us to increase brand awareness and generate more traffic to our website. It also gives us the opportunity to create a unique brand identity that differentiates us from our competitors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We want to gauge the level of interest in our product before we officially launch: By having a pre-launch website,
                        we can track the number of sign-ups we receive and analyze the data to see if there is a high level of interest in our product.
                        This helps us to better understand our target audience and make informed decisions about our marketing and launch strategies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We want to build a mailing list of interested visitors to keep them updated on our launch and future products:
                        Having a mailing list allows us to stay in touch with our audience and keep them informed about our product launch and future offerings.
                        This helps us to build a relationship with our audience and create a loyal customer base.
                        Additionally, it gives us the opportunity to collect feedback and suggestions from our audience that can be used to improve our product and services.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>HTML template</strong> that was used is the one supplied by the course lecturers (<a href="https://github.com/buas-media-interactive/prj4-group-template" target="_blank">which can be found here.</a>)</li>
                    <li>All <strong>UX patterns</strong> were retrieved from the Bootstrap library. However, for some icons, we have added a <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">'Font Awesome'</a>-kit into the code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Images</strong> that were not produced by students themselves were retrieved from <em>Pexels.com, Canva.com.</em></li>

                        Your testing <strong>goals</strong> &ndash; what you are trying to learn about your website?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Considering that our website is a pre-launch website, our main goals are to find out if the website's structure is intuitive and
                                if people can easily find the contact and newsletter forms. Informing and data gathering are the most important use cases of our website,
                                so we wanted to make sure it succeeds at both.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>
                                The test&rsquo;s <strong>participants</strong> (number, match with target audience, etc.): For the user testing, we had 4 participants.
                                They were aged 19-23, and 50% were foreigners currently living in the Netherlands. So, they are a bit younger than our target audience,
                                but we believe that they reflect the computer skills of our target audience.
                            <li>
                                The test&rsquo;s <strong>setting</strong> (which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home, etc.): The user testing has been
                                conducted on campus, by means of giving simple verbal task to the participants while they navigated the website on a laptop.
                            <li>
                                The test&rsquo;s <strong>protocol</strong> (what instructions are given, how it is recorded, etc.): We gave the participants several tasks:
                                Find out the product and the target audience, sign up for the newsletter, find the team behind the brand, ask a question to the team and find the brand mission.
                                The testing was recorded using a mobile phone, filming both the screen and the participant.

                                        <b>Negative:</b> One participants did not find the newsletter sign-up form at their first try. One participant noted that the text on top of the carousel was not as legible as it could be, due to conflicting colors.
                                    </li>

                                        We have overlayed the images with a slightly transparent layer of our pink color, so the text is better legible.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If we would have the time, we would have tried out ways to make the newsletter sign-up easier to find, tested them with users, and picked the best option.

                <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
            <p><b>Campaign name:</b><br>"Join-In Local"</p>
            <p><b>Objective:</b><br>Increase the average post engagement rate among female expats by 10% and gain 150 new female expat followers within a two-month period for the Join-In Local campaign on Instagram.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Campaign description:</b><br>Join-In Local is a community-driven campaign by the brand Join-In,
                which aims to connect and engage female expats in the Netherlands with their local communities. Through attractive visuals and informative captions,
                the campaign encourages people to explore and support local businesses, while building a sense of community.
                <br><br>
                Using attractive visuals, engaging storytelling, and informative captions,
                Join-In Local gives the spotlight to the charm and character of different neighborhoods,
                inspiring female expats to explore and support the local culture, while learning more about their new environment and finding the local gems.
                The campaign provides valuable recommendations, insider tips, and insights to help the target audience as well as the local businesses.
                <br><br>
                We chose Instagram as a main platform for promoting our brand Join-In and reaching the target audience - female expats in the Netherlands, because of the following factors:
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Visual Appeal:</b> Instagram is a visually-driven platform, perfectly suited for portraying the diverse and interesting experiences of female expats. By showcasing high-quality images and videos, 
                    Join-In can effectively capture the attention of its audience and send the message of the brand, products, and campaigns.</li>
                    <li><b>Target Audience Preference:</b> Instagram has a large and active user base, including a significant number of female users within the target age of 24 to 35. 
                    This makes it a very convenient platform for the brand to engage with the target audience and build a community.</li>
                    <li><b>Engaging Content Formats:</b> Instagram offers various content formats that can be used to increase engagement such as static images, videos and carousel posts, and stories.</li>
                    <li><b>Hashtags and Discoverability:</b> Instagram's hashtag system enables Join-In to improve discoverability and reach a wider audience. By strategically using relevant hashtags that represent the brand, target audience, and campaign themes, 
                    Join-In can extend its reach and attract new followers who are interested in topics related to expat life and local experiences.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
            <p>
                As we did not reach our objective, we believe that those were the reasons why:
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Insufficient Content Strategy: </b>The content strategy implemented during the campaign appeared not to effectively resonate effectively with the target audience. 
                    We believe that the content did not align with their interests, 
                    needs, or preferences which resulted in lower engagement and follower growth.</li>
                    <li><b>Limited Promotion and Reach:</b> We believe the promotion of the Join-In Local campaign was insufficient and we should have included other channels or platforms and this insufficiency may have limited the visibility and reach of the campaign. Cross-promoting the campaign on different social media platforms, 
                    email newsletters, or partnering with relevant influencers or organizations could have expanded its exposure and attracted more followers.</li>
                    <li><b>Lack of Consistency:</b> Consistency is crucial for maintaining engagement and follower growth and our campaign lacked consistency in posting frequency, 
                    which may have led to a decrease in audience interest and participation.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
            <p>
                As we mentioned above some mistakes were made which contributed to not reaching our goals therefore, we believe the initial things we would adjust would be:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Stronger Content Strategy – Additional interviews and research will be made in order to understand better our target audience and their interests, preferences and likings,
                        after which our content will be adjusted, including visuals, captions, hashtags and even promotional activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>Better Promotion and Reach – We will start using more platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn and even TikTok since they are pretty popular among the female expats, which would then help us reach more people.</li>
                    <li>Consistency – we would adjust our schedule, increasing the stories to 6-10 times a week, reducing the posts to 3 times a week, start incorporating reels (1-2 times a week) and even including lives at least once a month.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Here are some deas for developing our brand, gaining more followers and increasing engagement:
                <ol>
                    <li>Collaborations with local businesses: Join-In could partner with local businesses and brands that align with its values to promote each other's products and services. For example, a collaboration with a Dutch language school could lead to a joint campaign aimed at helping expats learn Dutch.</li>
                    <li>Influencer marketing: Join-In could work with influencers in its target demographic to promote its products and services. The influencers could share their experiences as expats in the Netherlands and how Join-In has helped them integrate into the community.</li>
                    <li>Interactive content: Join-In could create more interactive content to engage its audience and encourage them to share their own experiences. This could include polls, quizzes, challenges, or user-generated content campaigns.</li>
                    <li>Community building: Join-In's social media accounts could serve as a hub for its target audience to connect with each other and share tips and advice on living in the Netherlands. Join-In could host virtual events, such as webinars or Q&A sessions, to bring the community together.</li>
                    <li>Expansion of product line: Based on the success of its current products, Join-In could explore expanding its product line to include more items aimed at helping expats adjust to life in the Netherlands. This could include language learning resources, cultural guides, or online coaching services.</li>
                </ol>

            <p>
                Overall, Join-In could continue to focus on building a strong community of expats in the Netherlands and creating products and services that help them integrate and feel at home, while helping local businesses thrive. Social media can serve as a powerful tool for promoting these efforts and engaging with the target audience.

            <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
            <p>When creating and developing the trademark for our brand “Join-IN”, many deliberate decisions were made with the intention to appeal more to our target demographic of expats.</p>
            <p>Firstly, the name “Join-In” was chosen to reflect the concept of inclusivity and community, which is essential for expats who may be feeling isolated in their new country. The brand name is also concise, easy to remember and has a ’friendly’ tone, making it easier to remember which could be potentially helpful to our Brand recognition.</p>
            <p>The existing alternatives for brands that help expats integrate into Dutch culture often fail to cater to their specific need for information and the brands that do provide them with information fail to offer a sense of community within the brand, having very little brand recognition through trademarks or logo’s that may help customers feel included or part of something.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, creating and selecting the “Join-In” trademark has been influenced by the concept of inclusivity, diversity, community and useful market research.</p>
