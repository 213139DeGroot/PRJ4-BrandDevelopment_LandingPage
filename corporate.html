          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <h5>A colour scheme:</h5>

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li>
            <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #a4386b;"></span>
            #A4386B
            <em>We chose pink, because it can be associated with feelings of femininity, playfulness, and warmth. 
            It may also appeal to our target audience as a way to express their personal style and individuality.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #e7e5df;"></span>
            #E7E5DF
            <em>Light creamy colour is a versatile colour that can be paired with many other colours. 
            It can work well as a background colour for designs and can help other colours to stand out.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #2a2b2e;"></span>
            #2A2B2E
            <em>Dark grey is often associated with sophistication, elegance, and luxury. 
            It can help to create a sense of high-quality and premium-ness.
</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Font Choices:</h5>
        <p><b>- Abril Fatface</b> is a stylish and elegant font that adds a touch of sophistication to our brand. 
        It has thick and bold serifs that make it stand out, making it perfect for headlines and titles.<br> 
        <b>- Raleway</b> is a versatile sans-serif font that is widely used in various design projects. 
        It has a modern and clean look, with elegant and geometric shapes that give it a professional and sophisticated appearance. 
        This font is perfect for branding and advertising, as it easily communicates our brand message in a clear and concise way.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>User interface patterns:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Navigation bar:</b> A horizontal navigation bar that sticks to the top of the screen, 
                    making the navigation capabilities always accessible. Furthermore, when the website is accessed via a mobile phone, 
                    a dropdown menu appears, neatly hiding the navigation links behind a hamburger menu icon. 
                    This ensures that the navbar will not be too cluttered on mobile.</li>
                <li><b>Carousel:</b> We decided to go for a carousel as the 'hero'-element of our homepage, 
                    immediately welcoming the visitors with beautiful imagery of classic Dutch landscapes/views.
                    On top of that, we added a title and a button, to make the welcoming experience more personal.</li>
                <li><b>Links:</b> To be able to easily guide visitors towards other pages on the site itself, 
                    but also external pages (Instagram, Facebook), links have been used to make these other pages more accessible.</li>
                <li><b>Cards:</b> For certain important elements (testimonials, values, team members), we decided to make them
                    stand out more by using cards. This enabled us to add a different color, a shadow and a small hover animation.</li>
                <li><b>Forms:</b> We wanted to give our very interested visitors the possibility to sign up for our newsletter. 
                    Furthermore, we wanted to make it easy for our visitors to contact us. Hence, we used forms to enable visitors 
                    to fill in their information and/or message.</li>
                <li><b>Footer:</b> Most websites have a footer, and this is for a reason. It phisically closes off the website, 
                    while simultanuously enabling the developer to guide the visitor's attention to important links. 
                    We decided to put links to our social media pages on the footer, to generate more traffic on our social pages.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Structure of navigation and content</h5>
            <p>The navigation bar at the top of the page enables visitors to easily navigate through our website. 
            We decided to divide the site into 3 main pages: Home, About Us and Contact:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Home:</b> This page is the landing page, giving visitors a first impression of our brand and product. 
                    The imagery, colors, font and copywriting welcome the user to our brand. Here you will find information about 
                    the product and general information about our brand.</li>
                <li><b>About Us:</b> This page contains more in-depth information about our brand, such as: <em>Vision, Mission, Values, Persona</em> and <em>Our team.</em></li>
                <li><b>Contact:</b> This page is pretty self-explanatory: it gives visitors the opportunity to contact us.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h4 id="production-1.1" class="mt-2">Purpose</h4>
            <p> The purpose of this website is to serve as a <b>pre-launch website</b> for our product. We chose to take this approach, because:
            <ul>
                <li>We want to generate interest and buzz for our upcoming product launch: By creating a pre-launch website, we can start building excitement and anticipation for our product. 
                    This will help us to increase brand awareness and generate more traffic to our website. It also gives us the opportunity to create a unique brand identity that differentiates us from our competitors.</li>
                <li>We want to gauge the level of interest in our product before we officially launch: By having a pre-launch website, 
                    we can track the number of sign-ups we receive and analyze the data to see if there is a high level of interest in our product. 
                    This helps us to better understand our target audience and make informed decisions about our marketing and launch strategies.</li>
                <li>We want to build a mailing list of interested visitors to keep them updated on our launch and future products: 
                    Having a mailing list allows us to stay in touch with our audience and keep them informed about our product launch and future offerings. 
                    This helps us to build a relationship with our audience and create a loyal customer base. 
                    Additionally, it gives us the opportunity to collect feedback and suggestions from our audience that can be used to improve our product and services.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>All <strong>UX patterns</strong> were retrieved from the Bootstrap library. However, for some icons, we have added a <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">'Font Awesome'</a>-kit into the code.</li>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p><b>Campaign name:</b><br>"Join-In Your Community"</p>
          <p><b>Objective:</b><br>Encourage female expats in the Netherlands to engage with their local community and share their experiences through Join-In's social media accounts.</p>
          <p><b>Campaign description:</b><br>The "Join-In Your Community" campaign will highlight the importance of building connections within your local community, 
                especially for expats who may be feeling isolated or homesick. Join-In will encourage our followers to participate in various community events and activities, 
                and share their experiences with us by tagging Join-In's social media accounts in their posts.
            <br><br>
                To kick off the campaign, Join-In will create a social media post inviting our followers to share their favourite community event or activity in the Netherlands, 
                using the hashtag <em>#JoinInYourCommunity</em>. We will share some of the most interesting and engaging responses on our social media accounts, 
                along with photos or videos of our followers enjoying these events.
            <br><br>
                Finally, Join-In will create a series of events and activities designed to bring our followers together and help them build connections with each other and with the local community. 
                These events could include a city tour, a language exchange program, or a cultural festival, all with the aim of promoting inclusivity, adaptability, diversity, and community.
            <br><br>
                So far we have 8 Instagram posts and 4 Facebook posts, introducing the brand, our product and the campaign mentioned above.</p>
          
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
             <p>One key takeaway for our team was the need to undertake a rebranding effort and initiate new promotional activities, given that our previous branding efforts were proving inadequate in representing our brand properly and resonating with our target audience.
          <br><br>
             Upon conducting a thorough analysis of our visual identity, we discovered that our messaging was attracting a greater proportion of male followers as opposed to females, which was inconsistent with our intended target group. 
             To address this issue, we leveraged the advanced analytical tools provided by Instagram and Facebook, which enabled us to obtain a more nuanced understanding of the reach and engagement of our promotional campaigns, 
             as well as the behaviour of our followers and the individuals we reached through hashtags.
          <br><br>
             By carefully analysing these insights, we were able to optimise our messaging and visual identity to better align with the preferences and interests of our intended audience, 
             resulting in a more effective and impactful rebranding campaign.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>As we have many ideas for developing our brand, these are 5 activities we would focus on to develop our social media, gain more followers and increase engagement:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Collaborations with local businesses:</b> Join-In could partner with local businesses and brands that align with its values to promote each other's products and services. 
                    For example, a collaboration with a Dutch language school could lead to a joint campaign aimed at helping expats learn Dutch.</li>
                <li><b>Influencer marketing:</b> Join-In could work with influencers in its target demographic to promote its products and services. 
                    The influencers could share their experiences as expats in the Netherlands and how Join-In has helped them integrate into the community.</li>
                <li><b>Interactive content:</b> Join-In could create more interactive content to engage its audience and encourage them to share their own experiences. 
                    This could include polls, quizzes, challenges, or user-generated content campaigns.</li>
                <li><b>Community building:</b>Join-In's social media accounts could serve as a hub for its target audience to connect with each other and share tips and advice on living in the Netherlands. 
                    Join-In could host virtual events, such as webinars or Q&A sessions, to bring the community together.</li>
                <li><b>Expansion of product line:</b>Based on the success of its current products, Join-In could explore expanding its product line to include more items aimed at helping expats adjust to life in the Netherlands. 
                    This could include language learning resources, cultural guides, or online coaching services.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, Join-In could continue to focus on building a strong community of expats in the Netherlands and creating products and services that help them integrate and feel at home. 
                Social media can serve as a powerful tool for promoting these efforts and engaging with the target audience.</p>
